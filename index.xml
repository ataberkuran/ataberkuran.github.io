      <description>DUEL IT YOURSELF Game made for the Global Game Jam 2020. It is a two-player westen duel in space. Rebuild your weapon quickly, aim and fire. Be careful about the gravity, and if you miss, you have to repair your gun all over again. First player to hit the other player 3 times wins.
I have worked with a group throughout the Global Game Jam 2020. During the Global Game Jam, I came up with the concept of the game according to the theme which was &amp;ldquo;Repair&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>DePaul Originals Game Studio   Our tasks specifically for this quarter was to completely overhaul and redesign a new more compact city space. At the beginning of the quarter, well thought it was important to establish some idea of deadlines for where we as a team would want to be throughout the quarter. It also helped because we wanted to make sure the ideas for the new space were in scope as it appeared last quarter the city level was a bit too large to allow for an immersive experience.</description>
