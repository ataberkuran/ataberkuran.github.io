      <description>DePaul Originals Game Studio   Our tasks specifically for this quarter was to completely overhaul and redesign a new more compact city space. At the beginning of the quarter, well thought it was important to establish some idea of deadlines for where we as a team would want to be throughout the quarter. It also helped because we wanted to make sure the ideas for the new space were in scope as it appeared last quarter the city level was a bit too large to allow for an immersive experience.</description>
